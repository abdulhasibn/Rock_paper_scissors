# Rock_paper_scissors
In project I am going to use the skills I have learnt to create a rock, paper, scissors game.

Pseudocode for the program.

//A Function that gets a random output with the choices of "Rock , Paper and Scissors"
// to act as the computer's side.
  //no parameter required.
  //store these three strings in an array
  //select one randomly from the array
  //return it
//Another function for the logic of the game
//Two parameters - one from the computer's returned value and  
//another from the user's input, through the prompt
//compare these two
    //if two values are same, print(It's a tie)
    //a block of code that checks who wins according to the logic of the game
    // return the statement
//Another function to make the game run for five times iteratively
    //have to pass the previous function as a parameter
    //need to have a counter to store the scores of the players
    //a for loop to serve the purpose
    // and finally to display the scores and the winner in the console
